# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

## My Projects

### P1: Bay Area Bike Data Analysis

- For this initial project, you’ll step right into a data analyst’s shoes by investigating a raw dataset, and sharing your findings using a Jupyter Notebook. You’ll be working with real data provided by Bay Area Bike Share to determine differences in usage between commuters and tourists ridership patterns, average duration of trips, and more!

### P2: Descriptive Statistics

- In this project, you will demonstrate your knowledge of descriptive statistics by conducting an experiment dealing with drawing from a deck of playing cards and creating a write up containing your findings.

### P3: Intro to Data Analysis

- In this project, you will analyze a dataset (Titanic data) and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

### P4: Data Wrangling

- You will choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. Finally, you will choose either MongoDB or SQL as the data schema to complete your project.

### P5: Exploratory Data Analysis

- In this project, you will use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

### P6: Inferential Statistics

- In this project, you will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. You will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. You will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, you will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses.

### P7: Intro to Machine Learning

- In this project, you will play detective, and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

### P8: Create Tableau Story

- For this project, you will create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
